It counts from 0 to 3 only. Adds 1 when down is pressed and subtracts 1 when up is pressed. The problem is when i hold it, it counts continuously. I want it to count only once even if i hold the push button for a long time. I'm using ATMEL SAM3X microcontroller if that helps. And that the push buttons are logic 0.

    if(UP)                  //if UP is pressed

        delay_ms(50);
        if(Button_State==1)
        {
            UP_DOWN--;      //decrement
            if (UP_DOWN<0)
            {
                UP_DOWN=0;  // To ensure that the minimum value is 0
            }

        Button_State=0;
    }

    else if(DOWN)           //if DOWN is pressed
